## Ultra-detailed section specifications


### 01. Library header and create-project

**Visual anatomy / what this section shows.** Page title, asset counts, New Project dropdown.

**User workflow and behavior.** Creates project with workspace scope, template and rights policy; counts always from server with filters/permission scoping. Support mouse/keyboard navigation, accessible help, permission-appropriate action labels, clear selected/hover/focus/disabled states and responsive layout. Any change that affects analysis or a rendered artifact must visibly indicate unsaved, saved, pending-review, rejected, or published state as appropriate.

**Proposed persistence and source-of-truth mapping.** `otsi_library_items, otsi_reel_projects, otsi_reports, otsi_matches, otsi_workspaces`. Join through workspace authorization, match/asset IDs and run/version IDs rather than free-text player names. Read from normalized, independently versioned source records. Use rollups or precomputed spatial tiles only as caches, not as an untraceable source of truth. Source media binaries live in rights-protected object storage and all derived outputs retain parent asset IDs and checksums.

**Proposed service contract.** `GET /library/summary; POST /projects`. Inputs: the current `workspace_id`, `match_id`, `asset_id`, `analysis_run_id`, `player_id`, `project_id` and interval filters only where applicable. Responses should include stable ID, revision, server state, source attribution, `updated_at`, and `permissions` when an action is offered. Validate IDs server-side and return structured errors.

**Computation, consistency and safeguards.** New projects cannot inherit broader access accidentally. The UI must not change the evidence state from inferred to confirmed just because an analyst selected a row; confirmation requires a review decision. Interactively changing filters invalidates cached queries by ID, timestamp window and algorithm version. Client-side optimistic updates roll back on authoritative rejection.

**Visual states and acceptance scenarios.** Skeleton while loading; helpful explanation when empty; partial-result banner when upstream job is incomplete; explicit unavailable/permission denied; retryable failure with correlation reference; read-only state when viewer role lacks write permission. **Accept when:** this section renders correct persisted data after refresh, changes on user action are reflected in the intended dependent sections, actions are audit-logged, and no missing metric is replaced with an invented value.


### 02. Asset-type tabs

**Visual anatomy / what this section shows.** All Assets, Reels, Reports, Matches, Folders, Exports, Shared With Me, Templates counters.

**User workflow and behavior.** Tab changes type filter, refreshes server counts, preserves sort/search; show unread or permission badges when applicable. Support mouse/keyboard navigation, accessible help, permission-appropriate action labels, clear selected/hover/focus/disabled states and responsive layout. Any change that affects analysis or a rendered artifact must visibly indicate unsaved, saved, pending-review, rejected, or published state as appropriate.

**Proposed persistence and source-of-truth mapping.** `otsi_library_items, otsi_folder_items, otsi_share_permissions`. Join through workspace authorization, match/asset IDs and run/version IDs rather than free-text player names. Read from normalized, independently versioned source records. Use rollups or precomputed spatial tiles only as caches, not as an untraceable source of truth. Source media binaries live in rights-protected object storage and all derived outputs retain parent asset IDs and checksums.

**Proposed service contract.** `GET /library/assets?type=`. Inputs: the current `workspace_id`, `match_id`, `asset_id`, `analysis_run_id`, `player_id`, `project_id` and interval filters only where applicable. Responses should include stable ID, revision, server state, source attribution, `updated_at`, and `permissions` when an action is offered. Validate IDs server-side and return structured errors.

**Computation, consistency and safeguards.** Counters scoped to current user and workspace. The UI must not change the evidence state from inferred to confirmed just because an analyst selected a row; confirmation requires a review decision. Interactively changing filters invalidates cached queries by ID, timestamp window and algorithm version. Client-side optimistic updates roll back on authoritative rejection.

**Visual states and acceptance scenarios.** Skeleton while loading; helpful explanation when empty; partial-result banner when upstream job is incomplete; explicit unavailable/permission denied; retryable failure with correlation reference; read-only state when viewer role lacks write permission. **Accept when:** this section renders correct persisted data after refresh, changes on user action are reflected in the intended dependent sections, actions are audit-logged, and no missing metric is replaced with an invented value.


### 03. Search and advanced filters

**Visual anatomy / what this section shows.** Search textbox, Type/Competition/Team/Created By/Date range, Clear Filters.

**User workflow and behavior.** Debounced server search with safe query parsing, URL-encoded shareable filter state, AND/OR chip behavior and reset. Support mouse/keyboard navigation, accessible help, permission-appropriate action labels, clear selected/hover/focus/disabled states and responsive layout. Any change that affects analysis or a rendered artifact must visibly indicate unsaved, saved, pending-review, rejected, or published state as appropriate.

**Proposed persistence and source-of-truth mapping.** `otsi_search_index, otsi_library_items, otsi_competitions, otsi_teams`. Join through workspace authorization, match/asset IDs and run/version IDs rather than free-text player names. Read from normalized, independently versioned source records. Use rollups or precomputed spatial tiles only as caches, not as an untraceable source of truth. Source media binaries live in rights-protected object storage and all derived outputs retain parent asset IDs and checksums.

**Proposed service contract.** `GET /library/assets?q=&filters=&sort=&cursor=`. Inputs: the current `workspace_id`, `match_id`, `asset_id`, `analysis_run_id`, `player_id`, `project_id` and interval filters only where applicable. Responses should include stable ID, revision, server state, source attribution, `updated_at`, and `permissions` when an action is offered. Validate IDs server-side and return structured errors.

**Computation, consistency and safeguards.** Search never crosses tenancy boundary. The UI must not change the evidence state from inferred to confirmed just because an analyst selected a row; confirmation requires a review decision. Interactively changing filters invalidates cached queries by ID, timestamp window and algorithm version. Client-side optimistic updates roll back on authoritative rejection.

**Visual states and acceptance scenarios.** Skeleton while loading; helpful explanation when empty; partial-result banner when upstream job is incomplete; explicit unavailable/permission denied; retryable failure with correlation reference; read-only state when viewer role lacks write permission. **Accept when:** this section renders correct persisted data after refresh, changes on user action are reflected in the intended dependent sections, actions are audit-logged, and no missing metric is replaced with an invented value.


### 04. Saved searches

**Visual anatomy / what this section shows.** Chips for De Bruyne Analysis, UCL reels, tactical clips, set pieces; Save Current Search.

**User workflow and behavior.** Save named filter JSON, optional pinning, rename and delete, resolve stale filter IDs gracefully. Support mouse/keyboard navigation, accessible help, permission-appropriate action labels, clear selected/hover/focus/disabled states and responsive layout. Any change that affects analysis or a rendered artifact must visibly indicate unsaved, saved, pending-review, rejected, or published state as appropriate.

**Proposed persistence and source-of-truth mapping.** `otsi_saved_searches`. Join through workspace authorization, match/asset IDs and run/version IDs rather than free-text player names. Read from normalized, independently versioned source records. Use rollups or precomputed spatial tiles only as caches, not as an untraceable source of truth. Source media binaries live in rights-protected object storage and all derived outputs retain parent asset IDs and checksums.

**Proposed service contract.** `GET /saved-searches; POST /saved-searches; DELETE /saved-searches/:id`. Inputs: the current `workspace_id`, `match_id`, `asset_id`, `analysis_run_id`, `player_id`, `project_id` and interval filters only where applicable. Responses should include stable ID, revision, server state, source attribution, `updated_at`, and `permissions` when an action is offered. Validate IDs server-side and return structured errors.

**Computation, consistency and safeguards.** Do not leak shared saved searches. The UI must not change the evidence state from inferred to confirmed just because an analyst selected a row; confirmation requires a review decision. Interactively changing filters invalidates cached queries by ID, timestamp window and algorithm version. Client-side optimistic updates roll back on authoritative rejection.

**Visual states and acceptance scenarios.** Skeleton while loading; helpful explanation when empty; partial-result banner when upstream job is incomplete; explicit unavailable/permission denied; retryable failure with correlation reference; read-only state when viewer role lacks write permission. **Accept when:** this section renders correct persisted data after refresh, changes on user action are reflected in the intended dependent sections, actions are audit-logged, and no missing metric is replaced with an invented value.


### 05. Main asset table

**Visual anatomy / what this section shows.** Rows with checkbox, thumbnail/title, type badge, player thumbnails, collaborator avatars, updated time, status.

**User workflow and behavior.** Server pagination/virtualization; sort by verified timestamp, batch actions rights-aware, status state machine and row click selection. Support mouse/keyboard navigation, accessible help, permission-appropriate action labels, clear selected/hover/focus/disabled states and responsive layout. Any change that affects analysis or a rendered artifact must visibly indicate unsaved, saved, pending-review, rejected, or published state as appropriate.

**Proposed persistence and source-of-truth mapping.** `otsi_library_items, otsi_clips, otsi_reports, otsi_render_jobs, otsi_asset_collaborators`. Join through workspace authorization, match/asset IDs and run/version IDs rather than free-text player names. Read from normalized, independently versioned source records. Use rollups or precomputed spatial tiles only as caches, not as an untraceable source of truth. Source media binaries live in rights-protected object storage and all derived outputs retain parent asset IDs and checksums.

**Proposed service contract.** `GET /library/assets?cursor=; POST /library/bulk-actions`. Inputs: the current `workspace_id`, `match_id`, `asset_id`, `analysis_run_id`, `player_id`, `project_id` and interval filters only where applicable. Responses should include stable ID, revision, server state, source attribution, `updated_at`, and `permissions` when an action is offered. Validate IDs server-side and return structured errors.

**Computation, consistency and safeguards.** Show draft/published/exported separately; unavailable output is not downloadable. The UI must not change the evidence state from inferred to confirmed just because an analyst selected a row; confirmation requires a review decision. Interactively changing filters invalidates cached queries by ID, timestamp window and algorithm version. Client-side optimistic updates roll back on authoritative rejection.

**Visual states and acceptance scenarios.** Skeleton while loading; helpful explanation when empty; partial-result banner when upstream job is incomplete; explicit unavailable/permission denied; retryable failure with correlation reference; read-only state when viewer role lacks write permission. **Accept when:** this section renders correct persisted data after refresh, changes on user action are reflected in the intended dependent sections, actions are audit-logged, and no missing metric is replaced with an invented value.


### 06. Status and collaboration indicators

**Visual anatomy / what this section shows.** Published/Draft/Shared/Exported chips; small initials avatars and +N.

**User workflow and behavior.** Hover shows exact workflow and permission; status update requires role and transition validation; presence is not editing authorization. Support mouse/keyboard navigation, accessible help, permission-appropriate action labels, clear selected/hover/focus/disabled states and responsive layout. Any change that affects analysis or a rendered artifact must visibly indicate unsaved, saved, pending-review, rejected, or published state as appropriate.

**Proposed persistence and source-of-truth mapping.** `otsi_publication_events, otsi_memberships, otsi_share_permissions`. Join through workspace authorization, match/asset IDs and run/version IDs rather than free-text player names. Read from normalized, independently versioned source records. Use rollups or precomputed spatial tiles only as caches, not as an untraceable source of truth. Source media binaries live in rights-protected object storage and all derived outputs retain parent asset IDs and checksums.

**Proposed service contract.** `GET /library/assets/:id/access; POST /library/assets/:id/publish`. Inputs: the current `workspace_id`, `match_id`, `asset_id`, `analysis_run_id`, `player_id`, `project_id` and interval filters only where applicable. Responses should include stable ID, revision, server state, source attribution, `updated_at`, and `permissions` when an action is offered. Validate IDs server-side and return structured errors.

**Computation, consistency and safeguards.** Publishing may be blocked by rights or review state. The UI must not change the evidence state from inferred to confirmed just because an analyst selected a row; confirmation requires a review decision. Interactively changing filters invalidates cached queries by ID, timestamp window and algorithm version. Client-side optimistic updates roll back on authoritative rejection.

**Visual states and acceptance scenarios.** Skeleton while loading; helpful explanation when empty; partial-result banner when upstream job is incomplete; explicit unavailable/permission denied; retryable failure with correlation reference; read-only state when viewer role lacks write permission. **Accept when:** this section renders correct persisted data after refresh, changes on user action are reflected in the intended dependent sections, actions are audit-logged, and no missing metric is replaced with an invented value.


### 07. Selected-item video preview

**Visual anatomy / what this section shows.** Right-side reel thumbnail, play button, title, edit, descriptive tags.

**User workflow and behavior.** Playback uses short-lived stream; editing routes correct editor; missing preview falls back to poster and actionable recovery. Support mouse/keyboard navigation, accessible help, permission-appropriate action labels, clear selected/hover/focus/disabled states and responsive layout. Any change that affects analysis or a rendered artifact must visibly indicate unsaved, saved, pending-review, rejected, or published state as appropriate.

**Proposed persistence and source-of-truth mapping.** `otsi_library_items, otsi_media_assets, otsi_reel_projects`. Join through workspace authorization, match/asset IDs and run/version IDs rather than free-text player names. Read from normalized, independently versioned source records. Use rollups or precomputed spatial tiles only as caches, not as an untraceable source of truth. Source media binaries live in rights-protected object storage and all derived outputs retain parent asset IDs and checksums.

**Proposed service contract.** `GET /library/assets/:id; GET /media/:id/playback`. Inputs: the current `workspace_id`, `match_id`, `asset_id`, `analysis_run_id`, `player_id`, `project_id` and interval filters only where applicable. Responses should include stable ID, revision, server state, source attribution, `updated_at`, and `permissions` when an action is offered. Validate IDs server-side and return structured errors.

**Computation, consistency and safeguards.** Preview rights separate from download rights. The UI must not change the evidence state from inferred to confirmed just because an analyst selected a row; confirmation requires a review decision. Interactively changing filters invalidates cached queries by ID, timestamp window and algorithm version. Client-side optimistic updates roll back on authoritative rejection.

**Visual states and acceptance scenarios.** Skeleton while loading; helpful explanation when empty; partial-result banner when upstream job is incomplete; explicit unavailable/permission denied; retryable failure with correlation reference; read-only state when viewer role lacks write permission. **Accept when:** this section renders correct persisted data after refresh, changes on user action are reflected in the intended dependent sections, actions are audit-logged, and no missing metric is replaced with an invented value.


### 08. Selected-item metadata

**Visual anatomy / what this section shows.** Competition, match, players featured, author/date, duration, size, resolution and tags.

**User workflow and behavior.** Render authoritative metadata with provenance; edits validated; team and player links resolve canonical records. Support mouse/keyboard navigation, accessible help, permission-appropriate action labels, clear selected/hover/focus/disabled states and responsive layout. Any change that affects analysis or a rendered artifact must visibly indicate unsaved, saved, pending-review, rejected, or published state as appropriate.

**Proposed persistence and source-of-truth mapping.** `otsi_matches, otsi_media_technical_metadata, otsi_players, otsi_asset_tags`. Join through workspace authorization, match/asset IDs and run/version IDs rather than free-text player names. Read from normalized, independently versioned source records. Use rollups or precomputed spatial tiles only as caches, not as an untraceable source of truth. Source media binaries live in rights-protected object storage and all derived outputs retain parent asset IDs and checksums.

**Proposed service contract.** `GET /library/assets/:id/details; PATCH /library/assets/:id`. Inputs: the current `workspace_id`, `match_id`, `asset_id`, `analysis_run_id`, `player_id`, `project_id` and interval filters only where applicable. Responses should include stable ID, revision, server state, source attribution, `updated_at`, and `permissions` when an action is offered. Validate IDs server-side and return structured errors.

**Computation, consistency and safeguards.** Do not derive names just from thumbnails. The UI must not change the evidence state from inferred to confirmed just because an analyst selected a row; confirmation requires a review decision. Interactively changing filters invalidates cached queries by ID, timestamp window and algorithm version. Client-side optimistic updates roll back on authoritative rejection.

**Visual states and acceptance scenarios.** Skeleton while loading; helpful explanation when empty; partial-result banner when upstream job is incomplete; explicit unavailable/permission denied; retryable failure with correlation reference; read-only state when viewer role lacks write permission. **Accept when:** this section renders correct persisted data after refresh, changes on user action are reflected in the intended dependent sections, actions are audit-logged, and no missing metric is replaced with an invented value.


### 09. Selected-item quick actions

**Visual anatomy / what this section shows.** Download, Share, Duplicate, Send to Client, Open in Analysis.

**User workflow and behavior.** Each button rechecks resource-state, export rights, explicit client recipient and audit; duplication preserves lineage, not external delivery permissions. Support mouse/keyboard navigation, accessible help, permission-appropriate action labels, clear selected/hover/focus/disabled states and responsive layout. Any change that affects analysis or a rendered artifact must visibly indicate unsaved, saved, pending-review, rejected, or published state as appropriate.

**Proposed persistence and source-of-truth mapping.** `otsi_delivery_links, otsi_rights_grants, otsi_audit_events, otsi_reel_projects`. Join through workspace authorization, match/asset IDs and run/version IDs rather than free-text player names. Read from normalized, independently versioned source records. Use rollups or precomputed spatial tiles only as caches, not as an untraceable source of truth. Source media binaries live in rights-protected object storage and all derived outputs retain parent asset IDs and checksums.

**Proposed service contract.** `POST /library/assets/:id/share; POST /library/assets/:id/duplicate; POST /delivery/send`. Inputs: the current `workspace_id`, `match_id`, `asset_id`, `analysis_run_id`, `player_id`, `project_id` and interval filters only where applicable. Responses should include stable ID, revision, server state, source attribution, `updated_at`, and `permissions` when an action is offered. Validate IDs server-side and return structured errors.

**Computation, consistency and safeguards.** Never generate working download URL from a preview-only right. The UI must not change the evidence state from inferred to confirmed just because an analyst selected a row; confirmation requires a review decision. Interactively changing filters invalidates cached queries by ID, timestamp window and algorithm version. Client-side optimistic updates roll back on authoritative rejection.

**Visual states and acceptance scenarios.** Skeleton while loading; helpful explanation when empty; partial-result banner when upstream job is incomplete; explicit unavailable/permission denied; retryable failure with correlation reference; read-only state when viewer role lacks write permission. **Accept when:** this section renders correct persisted data after refresh, changes on user action are reflected in the intended dependent sections, actions are audit-logged, and no missing metric is replaced with an invented value.


### 10. Collaborator access control

**Visual anatomy / what this section shows.** Reviewer/analyst/editor avatars, Manage Access.

**User workflow and behavior.** Invite only authorized workspace roles; show role, pending invite and expiry; revoke invalidates future token authorization. Support mouse/keyboard navigation, accessible help, permission-appropriate action labels, clear selected/hover/focus/disabled states and responsive layout. Any change that affects analysis or a rendered artifact must visibly indicate unsaved, saved, pending-review, rejected, or published state as appropriate.

**Proposed persistence and source-of-truth mapping.** `otsi_memberships, otsi_asset_collaborators, otsi_invitations`. Join through workspace authorization, match/asset IDs and run/version IDs rather than free-text player names. Read from normalized, independently versioned source records. Use rollups or precomputed spatial tiles only as caches, not as an untraceable source of truth. Source media binaries live in rights-protected object storage and all derived outputs retain parent asset IDs and checksums.

**Proposed service contract.** `GET /assets/:id/collaborators; PATCH /assets/:id/access`. Inputs: the current `workspace_id`, `match_id`, `asset_id`, `analysis_run_id`, `player_id`, `project_id` and interval filters only where applicable. Responses should include stable ID, revision, server state, source attribution, `updated_at`, and `permissions` when an action is offered. Validate IDs server-side and return structured errors.

**Computation, consistency and safeguards.** No implicit anonymous link access. The UI must not change the evidence state from inferred to confirmed just because an analyst selected a row; confirmation requires a review decision. Interactively changing filters invalidates cached queries by ID, timestamp window and algorithm version. Client-side optimistic updates roll back on authoritative rejection.

**Visual states and acceptance scenarios.** Skeleton while loading; helpful explanation when empty; partial-result banner when upstream job is incomplete; explicit unavailable/permission denied; retryable failure with correlation reference; read-only state when viewer role lacks write permission. **Accept when:** this section renders correct persisted data after refresh, changes on user action are reflected in the intended dependent sections, actions are audit-logged, and no missing metric is replaced with an invented value.


## Specification status and implementation boundaries

- **Screen reference:** the rendered image is a visual design specification, **not evidence that live data or backend services exist**. All match scores, player stats, percentages, match footage, brands, client identities, usage totals, service capacities and timestamps shown in the image are illustrative fixtures until independently imported and verified.
- **Schema:** every `otsi_*` table, field and API endpoint in this document is a **proposed logical contract** for implementation. It is *not* a claim that such a table currently exists. During integration, maintain an explicit mapping from this contract to the real schema and do not overwrite canonical existing records.
- **Trust:** each computed quantity and player association MUST carry `evidence_state` (`DETECTED`, `INFERRED`, `CONFIRMED`, `NOT_MEASURED`), `measurement_method`, `source_asset_id`, `algorithm_version`, and, where meaningful, `confidence` and `reviewer_id`. A detected bounding box is not automatically a confirmed player identity. When the measurement is unavailable, show “Not measured”; never fabricate distance, speed, xG, precision, role or recognition accuracy.
- **Rights:** distinguish `INTERNAL`, `EXPORT_ALLOWED`, `PUBLIC`, `ANALYSIS_ONLY`, `UNKNOWN`, `EXPIRED`; sharing/download/export needs an export-entitled right at the point of delivery, independent of the right to analyze. Consent policies apply to minors. `RED`/rejected/unreviewed-for-export clips cannot be exported. Check rights again when a queued job executes or a signed link is opened.
- **Units/time:** persist clock times as integer milliseconds relative to source media and use a separate period/match-clock transform (stoppage time, halftime, seek discontinuities). Show distance in km only if camera calibration and acceptable measurement quality exist. Percentages must show a denominator and methodology tooltip.
- **Accessibility:** keyboard focus, semantic labels, 44px-equivalent touch targets where feasible, color + icon + text for statuses, captioning, reduced-motion variants for cinematic rays, and WCAG AA contrast. Desktop is primary; on tablet collapse inspectors into drawers; never hide safety controls.
- **Error contract:** backend errors include `code`, `message`, `correlation_id`, `retryable`, `field_errors` and an audit trail as appropriate. Loading, empty, permission-denied, partial-data, offline/reconnect, and retry states must be designed for each section.
- **Design tokens (proposed):** canvas `#06111F`, panel `#0C1D30`, raised `#10243A`, border `#1B3C56`, primary electric-blue `#079BFF`, cyan `#17D1F8`, amber `#F1A824`, text `#F4F8FF`, secondary text `#9CB1C5`; consistent 8px spacing scale, moderate 8–12px corner radius, typography for tabular numerals, restrained background glow. Exact production palette and OTSI logo asset must be approved; generated logo artwork is a concept only.

## Shared domain model and proposed relationships

`otsi_organizations(id, name)` owns `otsi_workspaces(id, organization_id, name)` and membership through `otsi_memberships(workspace_id,user_id,role)`. `otsi_matches(id,workspace_id,competition_id,home_team_id,away_team_id,kickoff_at,match_status)` owns `otsi_media_assets(id,match_id,storage_key,checksum,duration_ms,frame_rate,width,height,rights_id)` and `otsi_analysis_runs(id,asset_id,pipeline_version,status,started_at,finished_at)`. Each run owns `otsi_tracklets(id,run_id,temporary_object_id,start_ms,end_ms,team_id,quality_state)` and time-indexed `otsi_track_points(tracklet_id,pts_ms,bbox_x,bbox_y,bbox_w,bbox_h,visibility,occlusion_state)`; canonical identity is mapped through `otsi_identity_matches(tracklet_id,player_id,decision_state,confidence,reviewed_by,reviewed_at)` to `otsi_players(id,canonical_otsi_id,display_name,team_id,jersey_number)`.

`otsi_events(id,run_id,player_id,tracklet_id,event_type,start_ms,end_ms,evidence_state,confidence,source_method)` links `otsi_clips(id,asset_id,start_ms,end_ms,review_state,rights_snapshot_id)` and `otsi_clip_events(clip_id,event_id)`. A reel is `otsi_reel_projects(id,workspace_id,title,revision,status)` with ordered `otsi_reel_segments(id,project_id,clip_id,source_in_ms,source_out_ms,sequence,transform_json)` and `otsi_effect_keyframes(segment_id,tracklet_id,time_ms,effect_type,parameters_json)`. `otsi_render_jobs(id,project_id,revision,status,output_asset_id,progress,rights_check_at)` produces an encoded `otsi_media_assets` record and separately governed `otsi_delivery_links(id,asset_id,expires_at,rights_id,download_policy)`.

Quantified outputs are `otsi_measurements(id,subject_type,subject_id,metric_key,value,unit,source_run_id,measurement_method,evidence_state,confidence,quality_flags_json)`. `otsi_reports(id,workspace_id,player_id,run_id,report_version,status,output_asset_id)` links derived insights to provenance. `otsi_audit_events(id,actor_id,action,resource_type,resource_id,at,metadata_json)` records review, writes, publishing, sharing and downloads. Store original footage and binary reports in object storage, not relational BLOB fields; DB stores checksum, URI/storage key, content type, permissions, and versions. Implement real schema by migrations and read-only compatibility mapping, never by assuming these contracts already exist.

## Common service conventions

- `GET /api/v1/me`, `GET /api/v1/workspaces/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/matches/{id}` return permission-scoped identities and match context; every collection endpoint is cursor-paginated and server-filtered.
- `GET /api/v1/media/{id}/playback` returns short-lived authorized playback manifests; no public raw object-store credentials.
- `POST` mutation endpoints require authentication, workspace authorization, input validation, idempotency key for expensive jobs, CSRF defenses when session cookies are used, and audit logging.
- Long-running jobs publish versioned progress messages on `/api/v1/jobs/{id}/events` (SSE/WebSocket), with polling fallback, monotonic stage transitions and explicit failed/cancelled/retryable states. Never infer completion from frontend animation.
- Video annotation overlays are timestamped normalized coordinates, interpolated only across bounded valid track intervals. Hide boxes when the track is occluded/off-camera and indicate reidentification uncertainty on reentry.
- Design samples must include clear `DEMO DATA` markers in mock mode, especially on reports, rankings, metrics and public-facing trust claims.


## Page-specific acceptance test matrix

| Scenario | Expected behavior |
|---|---|
| Authorized analyst enters Library / Project Center | Correct match/project context, role, navigation and section-specific data load. |
| User has no data | Empty state guides import or creation without misleading placeholder metrics. |
| Source analysis only partly complete | Only genuinely available layers/sections work, unknown data remain unknown. |
| Selected item has ambiguous identity | Track ID may display; confirmed real-player identity and export actions remain gated. |
| User toggles/filter/searches | Server-scoped results update without losing unsaved work or playback sync. |
| Network disconnects | Current read-only view survives where possible; mutations queue only when safe, otherwise show retry. |
| User lacks export entitlement | Preview may remain if permitted; download/share delivery fails closed. |
| Rights or consent revoked after render queued | Recheck prevents output delivery even if an earlier preview existed. |
| Reload/deep link | Persisted state restores with current server truth and correct revision. |
| Tablet width | Secondary inspector collapses; primary task remains readable and keyboard accessible. |

## Data validation and release checklist

- Capture screenshot comparison with the corresponding image at desktop target and tablet layout; verify no clipping, overlap or placeholder-only controls.
- Unit-test all metric definitions, time transforms, state transitions, permission guards and API error types.
- Integrate source/evidence drilldown before enabling verified scouting/export badges.
- QA with a known match containing occlusions, camera cuts, substituted players, absent jersey numbers, multiple teams with similar kits and unseen players.
- Audit every displayed image metric; label sample fixture data in non-production environments.
- Verify export rights with a matrix including INTERNAL, EXPORT_ALLOWED, PUBLIC, ANALYSIS_ONLY, UNKNOWN, EXPIRED and guardian-consent restrictions.
- Instrument performance, accessibility, tracking provenance and rendering job failure analytics.

## Explicit non-claims

These UI visuals do **not** establish real integrations with UEFA, FIFA, clubs, Wyscout or Hudl; do not establish a real tracked player, a completed encoded reel, accurate physical measurements, live GPU stats, or an implemented production database. The implementation team must validate each capability before it is presented as production-ready.
